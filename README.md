# Coup-Game
In this exercise, we have implemented a the coup game program with a graphical user interface in which the user plays against 3 other players who are robots.
We have also added a new action to make the game more interesting:

Exchange:

Each player in his turn, in addition to the actions in the main game, must be able to exchange one of his cards by paying a coin to the treasury.
This card swap does not need to affect any cards and cannot be challenged or countered. When the player decides to take this action and pays a coin, he adds one of his cards of his choice to the pile of cards on the floor without showing it to the other players, and then one card from the pile of cards on the floor to The accident is selected and placed in this player's hand.
